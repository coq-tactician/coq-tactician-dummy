synopsis: "A dummy implementation of Tactician"
description: """
  This package acts as a stand-in for the Tactician plugin (`coq-tactician`).
  It provides short files that replicate Tactician's tactics without actually
  doing much. This is useful when you have a development that uses Tactician
  that you want to package up. In most situations, it is not a good idea to
  have your package directly depend on `coq-tactician`. Instead you should load
  Tactician through your `coqrc` file. In order for your package to be compilable
  by others, your package can depend on this package. Just add
  `From Tactician import Ltac1Dummy` in your development and you are good to go.
